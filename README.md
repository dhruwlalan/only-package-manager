> Use only-package-manager to run the right package manager.

[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/only-package-manager)](https://github.com/dhruwlalan/only-package-manager/blob/master/LICENSE) [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/only-package-manager)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/only-package-manager) [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/only-package-manager)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/only-package-manager)

## Why

Currently there are three main nodejs package managers, namely - `npm`, `yarn` & `pnpm`.<br>
Some projects use `npm` or some uses `yarn` or `pnpm`. Having to remember the syntax of all three is quite confusing for me and might be for you.<br>

Therefor using `only-package-manager` I have to just remember **ONE** default syntax for all the basic & the mostly used commands and the CLI will take care of running the right command based on the package manager the project is using.

I made this project getting inspired by [@antfu](https://github.com/antfu)'s [`ni`](https://github.com/antfu/ni) project and wanted to make one with my own set of syntax & to practice TypeScript. So a Huge credit to HimðŸ™Œ
